Diagnosis
The build failed due to errors in the JSX syntax in the ProductsPage.tsx file:

Line 71: The character > is mistakenly placed inside a JSX element.
Line 72: An unexpected closing a tag that does not match the opening div tag.
Line 73: An unterminated regular expression.
These errors are causing the build to fail when building the project with Vite.

Solution
Fix the JSX Syntax Errors:

Correct the placement of the > on line 23 in the ProductsPage.tsx file.
Ensure the closing tag matches the opening tag on line 25.
Properly terminate the regular expression on line 26.
After fixing the syntax errors, try building the project again.

If the errors persist, verify that the necessary packages are in the package.json file or that the file was committed to the repository.

Once the issues in the JSX syntax are corrected, the build should succeed without any errors.
